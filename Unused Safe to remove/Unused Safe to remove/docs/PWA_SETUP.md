# PWA Setup Guide

The HomieBites Admin Dashboard is now configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## Features Enabled

✅ **Installable** - Users can install the app on their devices
✅ **Offline Support** - Basic offline functionality with service worker
✅ **App-like Experience** - Standalone display mode
✅ **Fast Loading** - Cached assets for faster load times
✅ **Auto Updates** - Service worker auto-updates when new version is available

## Installation

### For Users:

1. **Desktop (Chrome/Edge)**:
   - Visit the admin dashboard
   - Click the install icon in the address bar
   - Or go to Menu → Install App

2. **Mobile (iOS Safari)**:
   - Open the dashboard in Safari
   - Tap the Share button
   - Select "Add to Home Screen"

3. **Mobile (Android Chrome)**:
   - Open the dashboard in Chrome
   - Tap the menu (3 dots)
   - Select "Add to Home Screen" or "Install App"

## Development

The PWA is configured using `vite-plugin-pwa`. The service worker is automatically generated during build.

### Build for Production:
```bash
npm run build
```

The service worker and manifest will be automatically generated in the `dist` folder.

### Testing PWA Locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The service worker works in development mode (enabled in vite.config.js).

## Configuration

- **Manifest**: Configured in `vite.config.js` under `VitePWA` plugin
- **Service Worker**: Auto-generated by vite-plugin-pwa
- **Icons**: Uses `/logo.png` (ensure this file exists in `public/` folder)
- **Theme Color**: `#449031` (HomieBites green)
- **Start URL**: `/admin/dashboard`

## Notes

- The app requires HTTPS in production for PWA features to work
- Service worker caches API responses for 5 minutes
- External resources (fonts, CDN) are cached for 1 year
- The app will prompt users to update when a new version is available
